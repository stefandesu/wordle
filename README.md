Wordle - before the NYT took over

Full credit goes to [Josh Wardle](https://powerlanguage.co.uk/).

## Changes From Original
- Removed Google Analytics.
- Updated lists for answers and possible words from NYT version (as of 2022-02-14).
  - I'm considering to automate this and do a nightly update via GitHub Actions.

## To-Dos
- Add some clarification/credits to the settings screen.
- Add documentation on how to move statistics from original to this one.
- Do we need the privacy policy? I feel bad about linking to Josh's site.
